To watch those beautiful replays, copy them into your neverball directory. Under linux 
and other unix-like systems, you need to copy them in "$HOME/.neverball/".

Actually this table is a 3-in-1 table, you can select if you want display "best time" records only, or "most coins" ones. "freestyle" category contains funny, acrobatic or lucky replays, where goal can be not reached at all !

<p style="background:#dee7ec;"><b>Warning : </b>some levels from "Mehdi" set are allowed with current packaged version from Neverball 1.4.0 only. A new version of Mehdi set will be release with next version of Neverball and some little architecture differences will make old replays incompatible with the new version, those levels will be deleted at this time. Concerned levels are : 04 (most coins only), 17 , 19, 21 and 22.
