    <p>A record should meet some conditions to be added in the table :</p>
    <br />
    <br />technical conditions <br />
    <p>- for "best time", the replay has to beat an existing one in the table,
or use an original path to reach the goal. Some levels are not
interesting for "best time" replays (like easy 1 and 3), for these
levels we do not accept replays.</p>
    <p>- for "most coins", the replay has to either beat an existing one or be
    the first replay for the level.</p>
    <p>- for "free style", the replay must be either lucky, unlucky or
    acrobatic and be different from the existing ones.</p>
    <br />
    <br />camera conditions <br />
    <p>Only the standard camera settings (or
    nearer from the ball) are accepted for "best time" and "most coins"
categories. Settings where the camera is more distant from the
ball are not accepted because in many cases it helps the player to
finish easily a level.</p>
    <br />
    <br />levels conditions <br />
    <p>Some levels are considered as not interesing for the contest. So, here the list
    of levels that are not accepted for "best time" categories : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy : 1,3,5,6,8,10,19,23</li>
        <li>Hard : 4,10,16,19</li>
        <li>Mehdi : 9</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Replays for those levels are of course welcomed in other categories ^-^
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />replay name recommendations <br />
    <p>A last thing ;) please, try to name your replay file as this standard, it's easier
    to manage : </p>
    <pre>
    [f|c] [E|H|M|N] [level] [name]
    </pre>
    <p>That means, in plain text :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, add 'f' for "freestyle", or 'c' for "most coins" replays</li>
        <li>Then 'E' for Easy set, 'H' for Hard and 'M' for Mehdi,</li>
        <li>level number,</li>
        <li>At the end your name shouldn't exceed 3 caracters, else it's not displayed
        correctly in neverball GUI at the moment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, a freestyle for easy 15 by toto : "fE15toto". That's simple ;)</p>
    <p>
    This "standard" is meant to be the default name for replay in next version of neverball.</p>
    <p>That's all folks ^-^</p>
